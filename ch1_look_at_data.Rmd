# Chapter 1 Notes

## Healy identifies 3 potential problem with visuals:

* **Aesthetic**

  Healy means that some figures look tacky or tasteless. 
  They have too many unnecessary effects that take away
  from the message that the visual is trying to convey. 
  Some of these features may include three-dimensional
  effects, shadows, cartoon characters, and other
  gimmicks. 

* **Substantive**
